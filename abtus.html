        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2024, we are committed to rescuing and rehoming stray pets. Stray pets are animals that have been abandoned or lost, often left to roam the streets without a home or proper care. These animals face many challenges, including hunger, exposure to the elements, and the risk of injury or disease. Without the support of loving families, strays can struggle to find food and shelter, and many also suffer from neglect or cruelty. Efforts to reduce the number of stray pets include responsible pet ownership, spaying and neutering, and community outreach programs to rescue and rehome these animals. By raising awareness and offering support, we can help ensure that every pet has a chance to live a safe, happy life.</p>

        <h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
        <p>Adopting a pet is a life-changing experience. By choosing to adopt, you’re giving an animal a second chance at life. Stray and abandoned pets often face difficult and uncertain futures, but through adoption, you provide them with love, stability, and the opportunity to thrive in a family environment. Adopt, don’t shop.</p>
